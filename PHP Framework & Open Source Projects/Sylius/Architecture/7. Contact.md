# Contact

The functionality of contacting the shop support/admin is in Sylius very basic. Each **Channel** of your shop may have a `contactEmail` configured on it. This will be the email address to support.

在Sylius中，联系店铺支持/管理员的功能是非常基本的。你店铺的每个频道都可以配置一个 "contactEmail"。这是提供服务咨询的电子邮件地址。



## Contact form

The contact form can be found on the `/contact` route.

联系表单可以在`/contact`路由上找到。

> Note：When the `contactEmail` is not configured on the channel, the customer will see the following flash message:

The form itself has only two fields `email` (which will be filled automatically for the logged in users) and `message`.



## ContactEmailManager

The **ContactEmailManager** service is responsible for the sending of a contact request email. It can be found under the `sylius.email_manager.contact` service id.



## ContactController

The controller responsible for the request action handling is the **ContactController**. It has the `sylius.controller.shop.contact` service id.



## Configuration

The routing for contact can be found in the `Sylius/Bundle/ShopBundle/Resources/config/routing/contact.yml` file. By overriding that routing you will be able to customize **redirect url, error flash, success flash, form and its template**.

You can also change the template of the email that is being sent by simply overriding it in your project in the `templates/bundles/SyliusShopBundle/Email/contactRequest.html.twig` file.
