## How to send an Email programmatically?

For sending emails **Sylius** is using a dedicated service - **Sender**. Additionally we have **EmailManagers** for Order Confirmation([OrderEmailManager](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/ShopBundle/EmailManager/OrderEmailManager.php)) and for Shipment Confirmation([ShipmentEmailManager](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/AdminBundle/EmailManager/ShipmentEmailManager.php)).

Tip

While using **Sender** you have the available emails of Sylius available under constants in:

- [Core - Emails](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/CoreBundle/Mailer/Emails.php)
- [User - Emails](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/UserBundle/Mailer/Emails.php)

Example using **Sender**:

```
/** @var SenderInterface $sender */
$sender = $this->container->get('sylius.email_sender');

$sender->send(\Sylius\Bundle\UserBundle\Mailer\Emails::EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN, ['sylius@example.com'], ['user' => $user, 'channel' => $channel, 'localeCode' => $localeCode]);
```



Example using **EmailManager**:

```
/** @var OrderEmailManagerInterface $sender */
$orderEmailManager = $this->container->get('sylius.email_manager.order');

$orderEmailManager->sendConfirmationEmail($order);
```
