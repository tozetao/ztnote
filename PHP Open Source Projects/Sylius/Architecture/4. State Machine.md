In **Sylius** we are using the [Winzou StateMachine Bundle](https://github.com/winzou/StateMachineBundle). State Machines are an approach to handling changes occurring in the system frequently, that is extremely flexible and very well organised.

在Sylius中，我们使用的是Winzou StateMachine Bundle。状态机是一种处理系统中经常发生的变化的方法，它非常灵活，组织性很强。

Every state machine will have a predefined set of states, that will be stored on an entity that is being controlled by it. These states will have a set of defined transitions between them, and a set of callbacks - a kind of events, that will happen on defined transitions.

每个状态机都会有一组预定义的状态，这些状态将被存储在一个被它控制的实体上。这些状态之间会有一组定义好的转换，以及一组回调 - 一种事件，会在定义好的转换中发生。



## States

States of a state machine are defined as constants on the model of an entity that the state machine is controlling.

状态机的状态被定义为状态机所控制的实体模型上的常量。

How to configure states? Let’s see on the example from **Checkout** state machine.

如何配置状态？让我们看看结账状态机的例子。

```yaml
# CoreBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine/sylius_order_checkout.yml
winzou_state_machine:
    sylius_order_checkout:
        # list of all possible states:
        states:
            cart: ~
            addressed: ~
            shipping_selected: ~
            payment_selected: ~
            completed: ~
```



## Transitions

On the graph it would be the connection between two states, defining that you can move from one state to another subsequently.

在图中，它是两个状态之间的连接，定义了你可以从一个状态移动到另一个状态。

How to configure transitions? Let’s see on the example of our **Checkout** state machine. Having states configured we can have a transition between the `cart` state to the `addressed` state.

如何配置过渡？让我们以我们的结账状态机为例来看看。在配置好状态后，我们可以在购物车状态和收银状态之间进行转换。

```yaml
# CoreBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine/sylius_order_checkout.yml
winzou_state_machine:
    sylius_order_checkout:
        transitions:
            address:
                from: [cart, addressed, shipping_selected, payment_selected]  # here you specify which state is the initial
                to: addressed                                                 # there you specify which state is final for that transition
```



## Callbacks

Callbacks are used to execute some code before or after applying transitions. Winzou StateMachineBundle adds the ability to use Symfony services in the callbacks.

回调是指过渡之前或之后执行一些代码。Winzou StateMachineBundle增加了在回调中使用Symfony服务的能力。

How to configure callbacks? Having a configured transition, you can attach a callback to it either before or after the transition. Callback is simply a method of a service you want to be executed.

如何配置回调？有了一个配置好的过渡，你可以在过渡之前或之后给它附加一个回调。回调只是一个你想执行的服务的方法。

```yaml
# CoreBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine/sylius_order_checkout.yml
winzou_state_machine:
     sylius_order_checkout:
          callbacks:
               # callbacks may be called before or after specified transitions, in the checkout state machine we've got callbacks only after transitions
               # 回调可以在指定的过度之前或之后调用，在checkout状态机中，我们只有在过渡之后才有回调
               after:
                    sylius_process_cart:
                        on: ["address", "select_shipping", "select_payment"]
                        do: ["@sylius.order_processing.order_processor", "process"]
                        args: ["object"]
```



## Configuration

In order to use a state machine, you have to define a graph beforehand. A graph is a definition of states, transitions and optionally callbacks - all attached on an object from your domain. Multiple graphs may be attached to the same object.

为了使用一个状态机，你必须事先定义一个图。图是对状态、转换和可选回调的定义 - 所有这些都附加在你领域对象上。多个图可以附加在同一个对象上。

In **Sylius** the best example of a state machine is the one from checkout. It has five states available: `cart`, `addressed`, `shipping_selected`, `payment_selected` and `completed` - which can be achieved by applying some transitions to the entity. For example, when selecting a shipping method during the shipping step of checkout we should apply the `select_shipping` transition, and after that the state would become `shipping_selected`.

在**Sylius**中，状态机的最好例子是checkout的那个。它有五个可用的状态： `cart`, `addressed`, `shipping_selected`, `payment_selected`和`completed` - 可以通过对实体应用一些过渡来实现。例如，当在结账的运输步骤中选择运输方式时，我们应该应用`select_shipping`过渡，之后状态将变成`shipping_selected`。

```yaml
# CoreBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine/sylius_order_checkout.yml
winzou_state_machine:
    sylius_order_checkout:
        class: "%sylius.model.order.class%" # class of the domain object - in our case Order
        property_path: checkoutState
        graph: sylius_order_checkout
        state_machine_class: "%sylius.state_machine.class%"
        # list of all possible states:
        states:
            cart: ~
            addressed: ~
            shipping_selected: ~
            payment_selected: ~
            completed: ~
        # list of all possible transitions:
        transitions:
            address:
                from: [cart, addressed, shipping_selected, payment_selected] # here you specify which state is the initial
                to: addressed                                                # there you specify which state is final for that transition
            select_shipping:
                from: [addressed, shipping_selected, payment_selected]
                to: shipping_selected
            select_payment:
                from: [payment_selected, shipping_selected]
                to: payment_selected
            complete:
                from: [payment_selected]
                to: completed
        # list of all callbacks:
        callbacks:
        # callbacks may be called before or after specified transitions, in the checkout state machine we've got callbacks only after transitions
            after:
                sylius_process_cart:
                    on: ["address", "select_shipping", "select_payment"]
                    do: ["@sylius.order_processing.order_processor", "process"]
                    args: ["object"]
                sylius_create_order:
                    on: ["complete"]
                    do: ["@sm.callback.cascade_transition", "apply"]
                    args: ["object", "event", "'create'", "'sylius_order'"]
                sylius_hold_inventory:
                    on: ["complete"]
                    do: ["@sylius.inventory.order_inventory_operator", "hold"]
                    args: ["object"]
                sylius_assign_token:
                    on: ["complete"]
                    do: ["@sylius.unique_id_based_order_token_assigner", "assignTokenValueIfNotSet"]
                    args: ["object"]
```
