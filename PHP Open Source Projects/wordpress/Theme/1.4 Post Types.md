# Post Types

There are many different types of content in WordPress. These content types are normally described as Post Types, which may be a little confusing since it refers to all different types of content in WordPress. For example, a post is a specific Post Type, and so is a page.

WordPress 中有许多不同类型的内容。这些内容类型通常被描述为 "Post Types"，这可能有点令人困惑，因为它指的是 WordPress 中所有不同类型的内容。例如，一个post（帖子）是一种特定的Post Type，page（页面）也是。

Internally, all of the Post Types are stored in the same place — in the wp_posts database table — but are differentiated by a database column called post_type.

在内部，所有Post Types都存储在同一个地方 - wp_posts 数据库表中，但通过名为 post_type 的数据库列来区分。

In addition to the default Post Types, you can also create Custom Post Types.

除了默认的帖子类型，你还可以创建自定义帖子类型。

The [Template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/) page briefly mentioned that different Post Types are displayed by different Template files.  As the whole purpose of a Template file is to display content a certain way, the Post Types purpose is to categorize what type of content you are dealing with. Generally speaking, certain Post Types are tied to certain template files.

在[Template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/) 这一节中简要提要，不同的Post Types是通过不同的模板文件来展示的。模板文件的目标是以某种方式显示内容，而Post Types的目的是对要处理的内容进行分类。一般来说，特定的Post Types与对应的模板相关联。



## [Default Post Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/#default-post-types)

There are several default Post Types readily available to users or internally used by the WordPress installation. The most common are:

有几种默认的Post Types可用用户使用，常见的有：

- Post (Post Type: ‘post’)

    post

- Page (Post Type: ‘page’)

    页面（page）。

- Attachment (Post Type: ‘attachment’)

    附件

- Revision (Post Type: ‘revision’)

- Navigation menu (Post Type: ‘nav_menu_item’)

    导航菜单

- Block templates (Post Type: ‘wp_template’)

    块模板

- Template parts (Post Type: ‘wp_template_part’)

    模板部件

The Post Types above can be modified and removed by a plugin or theme, but it’s not recommended that you remove built-in functionality for a widely-distributed theme or plugin.

上面的Post Types可以通过插件或主题进行修改或移除，但是不推荐你去移除一个广泛传播的主题或插件的内置功能。

It’s out of the scope of this handbook to explain other post types in detail. However, it is important to note that you will interact with and build the functionality of [navigation menus](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/navigation-menus/) and that will be detailed later in this handbook.

详细解释其他帖子类型超出了本手册的范围。不过，需要注意的是，您将与导航菜单进行交互并构建其功能，本手册稍后将对此进行详细介绍。



### [Post](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/#post)

Posts are used in blogs. They are:

博文用于博客，博文是：

- displayed in reverse sequential order by time, with the newest post first

    按时间倒序显示，最新的博文在前。

- have a date and time stamp

    拥有日期和时间戳。

- may have the default [taxonomies of categories and tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies/) applied

    可应用默认的分类和标记对内容进行分类。

- are used for creating feeds

    可以用于创建feeds。

The template files that display the Post post type are:

显示Post类型的模板文件有：

- `singl`e and `single-post`

    single和single-post

- `category` and all its iterations

- `tag` and all its iterations

- `taxonomy` and all its iterations

- `archive` and all its iterations

- `author` and all its iterations

- `date` and all its iterations

- `search`

- `home`

### [Page](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/#page-2)

Pages are a static Post Type, outside of the normal blog stream/feed. Their features are:

- non-time dependent and without a time stamp
- are not organized using the categories and/or tags taxonomies
- can be organized in a hierarchical structure — i.e. pages can be parents/children of other pages

The template files that display the Page post type are:

- `page` and all its iterations
- `front-page`
- `search`
- `index`

### [Attachment](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/#attachment)

Attachments are commonly used to display images or media in content, and may also be used to link to relevant files. Their features are:

- contain information (such as name or description) about files uploaded through the media upload system
- for images, this includes metadata information stored in the wp_postmeta table (including size, thumbnails, location, etc)

The template files that display the Attachment post type are:

- `MIME_type`
- `attachment`
- `single-attachment`
- `single`
- `index`

## [Custom Post Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/#custom-post-types)

Using Custom Post Types, you can **create your own post type**. It is not recommend that you place this functionality in your theme. This type of functionality should be placed/created in a plugin. This ensures the portability of your user’s content, and that if the theme is changed the content stored in the Custom Post Types won’t disappear.

You can learn more about [creating custom post types in the WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/registering-custom-post-types/).

While you generally won’t develop Custom Post Types in your theme, you may want to code ways to display Custom Post Types that were created by a plugin.  The following templates can display Custom post types:

- `single-{post-type}`
- `archive-{post-type}`
- `search`
- `index`
